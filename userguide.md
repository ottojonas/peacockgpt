## Issues and Bugs

I am still actively working on and developing PeacockGPT, and therefore there will most likely be bugs and issues with the application.
When you run into an issue, please contact me via teams (Otto Jonas) or [email](mailto:otto.jonas@peacocksalt.co.uk), preferably with a recording of the issue for my understanding (you can do this with the 'Snipping Tool' application which is installed by default on Windows machines), and I will then start working on fixing the issue and update the application when the fix is implemented.
If you wish to see the development progress and the timeline for any issues found, you are able to check on this link: [PeacockGPT GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ottojonas/peacockgpt)

## Uninstalling PeacockGPT

The process to uninstall PeacockGPT is the same as any other application.
