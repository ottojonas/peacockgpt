### 2. Installation Instructions

```markdown
## Installation

To get started with PeacockGPT, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm (>=6.x) or yarn (>=1.x)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/peacockgpt.git>
cd peacockgpt
```


### Install Dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install

```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn install

```

Using pip: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using pip in a virtual environment 

To avoid the `externally-managed-environment` error, you should create a virtual environment and install the dependencies within it. Here are the steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv ../peacockgpt/backend/venv
    ```
    
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    source ../peacockgpt/backend/venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
3. Install the dependencies using `pip`:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r ../peacockgpt/backend/requirements.txt
    ```
    

This will install the dependencies in the virtual environment, avoiding conflicts with the system-wide Python installation.
